This repository is a set of configuration files shared between a Mac (nix-darwin), and a Linux Machine (NixOS). Please read README.md for more information.

You are currently running on the Linux Machine (NixOS).

Your task is to help improve the linux-specific configurations (as instructed by the user). Any changes made to the system should _only_ be made through these configs. You should never solve a problem by making a change to the current system directly.

Any change you make should _only_ impact the Linux system. If a change you make would impact the Mac system, you should first warn the user and ask for their permission to make the change.

The user is a Mac user and is not acutely aware of possible linux solutions. You should make recommendations when necessary for Linux software, or Linux alternatives to the Mac configuration present in this repository.

You should always make changes to these configurations in the most canonical way possible. Please reference other configuration repositories on GitHub to learn more about how other users have structured their configurations for various software when searching for solutions to a common problem.
