This repository is a set of configuration files shared between a Mac (nix-darwin), and a Linux Machine (NixOS). Please read README.md for more information.

You may either be running on the Linux system, or the Darwin system. Before making assumptions, please check by running `uname`.

Your task is to help improve these configurations (as instructed by the user). Any changes made to the system should _only_ be made through these configs. You should never solve a problem by making a change to the current system directly.

Any change you make should _only_ impact the current system. If a change you make would impact the other system, you should first warn the user and ask for their permission to make the change.

You should always make changes to these configurations in the most idiomatic way possible. Please reference other configuration repositories on GitHub to learn more about how other users have structured their configurations for various software when searching for solutions to a common problem.

When referencing nix-darwin options consult this page: https://nix-darwin.github.io/nix-darwin/manual/

The user uses Neovim. When suggestions for vim changes are made always prefer Neovim solutions where they exist.

Never assume your documentation is up to date. Always read documentation before implementing. Read the project's README.MD if it exists on GitHub.
